			<h1>Temple html!</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to temple_html, a short interactive text game, based on
				the temples of ancient Egypt!
			</p>
			<p>
				Are you ready to step into the shoes of a priest of one of these
				temples, to learn and navigate its rooms to fufill your duties?
				Press on ahead, but be sure to read the guide below.
			</p>
			<h2>Valid commands</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a class="ritual">/east/south/west<a/>
					- This allows you to move around the temple. You can add an
					additional value to make quick strides through the long
					hallway and large courtyard!
				</li>
				<li>
					<a class="ritual">ritual [god/place] [object/action]</a> - The most important
					thing you can do as a priest! Be sure to reference the room
					with <strong>look</strong> and your items with
					<strong>inventory</strong> to get clues on what to do, and
					that you can perform the task.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a class="ritual">look</a> - When a glance at the room isn't enough, you can look around for a better description of the room, as well as some hints for rituals and items.
				</li>
				<li><a class="ritual">map/area</a> - While you should have your trusty paper map on you to help you navigate, you can get a feel of the nearby rooms and area with this.</li>
				<li>
					<a class="ritual">inventory/stuff</a> - Check your pockets for what you have on you. Useful to make sure you grabbed the offering you needed for a ritual.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a class="ritual">get/grab</a> - Pick up an item in a room. Do note that picking up items after performing rituals with them <strong>RESET THE RITUAL</strong>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a class="ritual">drop/place</a> - Put down an object from your inventory. Required for some rituals as the item needs to be interacted with, and not used.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Remember, you can reference this again with the <strong>help</strong> command while you play!
