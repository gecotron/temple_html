			<ul>
				<li>
					Temples often housed small communities dedicated to the
					gods, not just priests!
				</li>
				<li>
					Barques usually contained boats that would carry the statue
					of the primary god, and not house the gods box itself. The
					box was usually kept behind the altar in the sanctuary.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Please note that a level of liberty was taken in the design of
				this temple to provide a better game experience.
