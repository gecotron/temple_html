# The daily life of a temple worker in Egypt

A simple and short text & image based game where you must learn to navigate a day living in a temple in ancient Egypt. In order to make it through the day you have to navigate through the temple and complete rites and ceremonies in the correct order.

Written for a history project, designed to provide a simple learning experience about the temples of ancient Egypt, and the day to day life of priests who lived in them.

## Playing the game.

The game is a small bundle files contained within the `src/` directory. To play, download a copy of the repository and open the `index.html` file. All paths are relative, so the need to host a webserver **should** be unnecessary.
